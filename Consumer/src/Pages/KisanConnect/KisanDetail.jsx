                                    Hello, I'm {LimitedKisan[kisanID].name}, a farmer with several years of experience. My family has a long history of farming,
                                    and I'm proud to carry on this tradition. I started farming about 10 years ago and have been actively involved in
                                    agricultural practices ever since. When I first started farming, I focused on cultivating onions and tomatoes. It
                                    took me about a year to learn the ins and outs of these crops and effectively harvest them. Challenges are inevitable
                                    in farming, and I have faced some natural issues along the way. However, with perseverance and the support of my family,
                                    I overcame these challenges.
